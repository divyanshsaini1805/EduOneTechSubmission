## Used Tech Stacks
React.js - react-bootstrap, react-router-dom 
Firebase - for auth
Netlify - for hosting

### Description
The UI designed is kept simple but goodlooking for ease of understanding,
React.Js is preferred over regular HTML/JS since it is easy to handle routes with the former using react-router-dom.
Styling is done using react-bootstrap and CSS and react-styled-components.

The project allows user to SignUp, if not registered and SignIn if done already.
The auth is done purely from firebase end, also displaying the errors if any occur.
